# A file combining tool for competitive programming

More often then not, competitive programming websites requires
you to output only one file.
This tool combines your custom libraries and source code into a single file for submission.

## Compilation

This tool has no dependencies, and is only a single file. So, for compiling, you would only need to

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o filecombiner
```

## Configuration

By default, you would need to use "~/.config/fileCombiner/config" path for configuration. This can be changed in source code

Configuration file is in the following format:

1. an arbitrary number of lines containing path to the files you want added to your source code
2. a single empty line as a delimeter
3. an arbitrary number of lines containing the '\#include's you want to be removed from the final code

## Usage

```bash
filecombiner {Main Source Code} {Output file, Optional, by default ./autoGenerated.cpp} {Configuration path, optional, by default ~/.config/fileCombiner/config}
```
